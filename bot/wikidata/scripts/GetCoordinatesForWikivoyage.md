# Get Coordinates for Listing

This is less a bot and more a utility script for lazy people like me :)
We often have to enter `lat`, `long` and `wikidata` in the `listing` template (
see, do, buy, eat, drink, sleep, citt√† etc..) and copying and pasting from Wikidata
or from other sources is cumbersome. This script does it for you, printing the 
string ready to be pasted in the listing template.


## Usage

see general setup in the [README.md](../../../README.md) file.
Since this is a wikidata "bot", you'll need to add the folder in the `user-config.py` file

### Run

* **Minimal**: runs for all files in the category. Per default we dump, not modify the articles

```bash
pwb get_wikivoyage_coordinates -item:Q3033
```

will output:

```
| lat= 51.5339 | long= 9.93556 | wikidata= Q3033
```
